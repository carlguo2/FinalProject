## Project Proposal

For this project, I plan on recreating the game Space Invaders or trying to create something similar
to that. I believe that this should be doable after seeing how the Snake game worked in openFrameworks.
I plan on having this game be similar to space invaders but possibly with less enemies and without cover
to protect the player. The game will be the same as the actual Space Invaders game, by having each wave
of enemies loop after one wave has been destroyed. Similar to Snake, I plan on implementing different
game states, a scoring system, and a high score list. However I will also attempt to add audio as well.
	
I currently plan on using the Game Engine library Torque 2D games (https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque2D)
to create my final project. I am not completely sure how I will integrate openFrameworks into it but I will try
to do some research on that. I believe that the ofxgui from openFrameworks may also be useful as well. In order to 
learn how to use this game engine I will read the guide they provide (https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque2D/wiki)
and probably also use the forum (http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/84). There are also other game engine 
libraries worth looking into from the libraries guide we were given from piazza (https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp#game-engine)

I have had previous experience with game design. I took CS 199 GAM during Winter 2017 and learned how
make games and code in Unity. I am not completely sure if Unity will be entirely similar to this
new game engine library, but I believe the experience I have with Unity will prove useful.

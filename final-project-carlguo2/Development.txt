### Code Review 1
Created all of my classes relevant for creating a basic game. 
Took a while to actually get the project to generate with the addon. Later had to manually 
add on the ofxOSC addon using the openFrameworks nuget extension.
I kept getting an error that my png image for player wasn't found and later learned
I needed to store the image inside my bin folder. Also had a problem where keyPressed() could 
only take one key parameter so in order to get the player to be able to move diagonally, created own 
booleans to return whether a key was pressed or not. Had to adjust a lot of dimensions and values since I 
used the Snake game as reference and will plan on creating variables to avoid magic numbers. Next week will
plan to get game sense collision, display score, have audio, and high score list.
